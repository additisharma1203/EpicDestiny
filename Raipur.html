    <p>The city is known for its temples, lakes, factories, educational centres as well as the development of Naya Raipur. Naya Raipur is a newly planned city and is about 17km away from the current town. The Swami Vivekananda Airport lies in between Raipur and Naya Raipur facilitating travel.</p>
    <p>Raipur has a rich history and until 2000 was a part of Madhya Pradesh. After the formation of the new state of Chhattisgarh, Raipur was made its capital, primarily because of its centralised location. Located in the centre of the plains that are also called the ‘rice bowl of India’, Raipur is surrounded by the districts of Durg and Bemetara. </p>
