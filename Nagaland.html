        Kohima is the hilly capital of Nagaland, which is one of the seven sister states of India. ‘Kohima’ is the anglicized name given by the British, the original name being 'Kewhira' derived from the Kewhi flowers found in the region. Famous for its ethereal environment and untouched beauty, it is a land of folklore passed down through the ages. Situated at a height of 1500 metres above the sea level, it is endowed with quaint hills, emerald forests and a picturesque landscape. It is the go-to place for all you adventure enthusiasts as it is ideal for trekking, camping and hiking.<br><br>
        Kohima was built by the British and is home to the Naga and Kulkis tribe who can amaze one with their independence and a mystical and colourful culture that surrounds them. Kohima finds its place in history as the site of an intense fight with the Japanese, a part of a 64 day long battle during the World War II. One of the most popular sits here include the Commonwealth War Cemetery which homes thousands of soldiers of the World War II. Other than that, the city has a lot more to offer to its visitors - a museum, zoo, sanctuary, valleys, self governing villages and much more.

        <b>History of Kohima </b><br>
        Kohima was initially inhabited by the Angami Naga tribes, one of the largest of its kind. In around 1840, the British started the incursions to take on the territory which was met by stringent resistance by the freedom loving Nagas, who had never been conquered by any empire before. For this fact, the British took around four decades to capture the comparatively tiny territory. Kohima was the first seat of British modern administration as the headquarters of Naga Hills District in 1879. It has also been etched in history for the infamous Battle of Kohima during the Burma Campaign in 1944 at the time of World War 2. It was a 64-day long war with the Japanese who eventually lost to the allies. Afterwards, post-independence, when Nagaland became a full-fledged state in 1963, Kohima was made its official capital.
