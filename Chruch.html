    <p>Located in Panjim, Our Lady of Immaculate Conception is one of the most popular and also one of the oldest chapels in Goa. Built in a Portuguese Baroque style, the church is located on a slight elevation, on a hillock. It is known to house the second largest church bells in Goa. These bells are known to have been removed from the Augustinian ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace that existed in Old Goa.</p>
    <p>The Immaculate Conception Church was originally built in 1541 but was replaced by a much larger structure in the 1600s. The facade of the church is painted an immaculate white with a double flight of stairs zigzagging to the hilltop where it is located. The view of the sunset and the church lit up at night is a soothing sight to witness. </p>
    <p>The church attracts a throng of locals and tourists on the festival of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception which is help on 8 December each year.</p>
