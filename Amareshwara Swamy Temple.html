                <p>Shiv Linga has a red stain on it, as the saying goes Shivalinga was getting bigger, so a nail was driven at the top of it,it looks like the nail went thorugh the Shivlinga,blood started coming out from it.</p>
                <p>The holy place embraces a 15 ft high marble Shiv Ling. It is believed that Lord Shiva is present in the structure of five lingams - Pranaveswara, Agasteswara, Kosaleswara, Someswara and Parthiveswara.</p>
