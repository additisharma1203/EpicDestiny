        <b>From Gaurimarg to Gulmarg </b><br>
        Gulmarg, one of the charming luxury hill stations in India, has a legendary history that is often spoken of. The place got its current name in the 16th century from Sultan Yusuf Shah before which it was called ‘Gaurimarg’ meaning ‘the fair one’ by the local shepherds and residents.
        <br>The history of this city dates back to the era of Emperor Jahangir, impressed by the valleys and meadows who came to this place as a summer retreat. Mughal kings ruled this place for decades before the colonial rule which marked this city for its beauty and charm. The Britishers established ski grounds and resorts for the holiday season during Christmas and Easter. After the end of colonial rule, Gulmarg became a part of the independent princely state of Jammu and Kashmir where now it is a top tourist destination flooded by people serenading its beauty.
