        Known as the resting place of Lord Shiva, the majestic history and heritage of Puri date back to the 3rd century B. C. Puri, Konark and Bhubaneshwar complete the Golden Triangle of Orissa, with their religious significance and cultural heritage being the centres of tourism in this state. There are a lot of places near Puri that one must visit, like the Chilika lake, Puri beach, Gundicha Ghar and the very famous Sun temple of Konark. Puri is soon turning into an industrial hub with major manufacturing companies coming here.

        Culture is a blend of mind and spirit where people exist in an environment with their growing art, customs and practices. Puri, in Odisha, adapts its culture from various festivals which are celebrated through the year. Amongst these festivals, Rath Yatra at Jagannath Temple is of great significance. In addition to these festivals, Puri extracts its culture from other festivals like the Snana Yatra, Chandan Yatra and the Car festival. The Chariot festival or Rath Yatra is however native to the state of Odisha, yet it is celebrated across India. Puri is also a birthplace of many religious cults such as Vaishnavism. The historic Jagannath culture of Puri was also sculpted out of Vaishnavism. Since Puri is situated on the shore of the state, its traditional art form includes seashell crafts. Puri’s culture is a symbolic representation of its history, architecture, literature, art and craft with a dominance of worship culture.
