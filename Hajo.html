         <h2>Kamesware Temple</h2>
         <p>The Kamesware Temple is an ancient temple, built in the 18th century by the Ahom king Pramatta Singha. </p>
         <p>Quite later after its construction, it was turned into a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The shivlinga here resembles that in Kedarnath.</p>
