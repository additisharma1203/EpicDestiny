        <b>Mythology </b><br>
        Evidence, such as temples and idols found in and around Dehradun, suggest that the history of Dehradun can be linked to the times of Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is said that Lord Ram and his brother Lakshman visited this place to perform an atonement after the battle with Ravana in Lanka.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>History of Dehradun </b><br>
        The name ‘Dehradun’ has been derived from two distinct words - ‘Dehra’ (from ‘dera’) meaning home and ‘Doon’ meaning a valley between Himalayas and Shivaliks (Dehradun lies in the Doon Valley). When Guru Ram Rai visited this place with his followers, he set up a camp here. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun began developing. Many historians have opined that ‘Dehra’ can be used to refer to camping, thus the name ‘Dehradun’ - The Campsite of Doon. The city also finds mention in the ancient epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata.
