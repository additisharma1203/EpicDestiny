<br><br>
1. Bargain as much as you can. Quote a price less than half of what has been told to you. The shopkeepers try to con the tourists as they have no idea about the actual price.<br>
2. Do not be fooled into thinking that any product is original or authentic. Almost all of them are first copies or duplicates.<br>
3. Keep a note on the weighing balance. Sometimes the balance is tempered to display wrong weights of products like spices etc.<br>
4. Keep clear of the pick-pockets and smugglers and pay special attention to your valuables- phones, wallets etc.<br>
5. Open Time : Mid-November to End of April

    <p>Anjuna Flea Market on Wednesday is a treasure trove of trinkets, handicrafts, hippie clothing, souvenirs and everything else from cheap bags to footwear and junk jewellery. Also popular as the queen of hippie flea markets, the Anjuna Flea Market as much a part of the Goa experience as the beaches. Offering a multiple range of products from Keralan spices, to Kashmiri jewellery, wooden toys from Karnataka to Jimi Hendrix t-shirts, the market is a must-visit.</p>
    <p>Besides the trinkets and regular knick-knacks, Anjuna Flea Market also hosts live music and band performances. One can relish amazing sea-food and cold beer from the shacks on the beach. Originally, the flea market covered a small area on the beach but nowadays it sprawls from the golden shores back to the paddy fields with umpteen stalls selling tidbits.</p>
