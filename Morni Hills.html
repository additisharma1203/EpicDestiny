        <p>Morni Hills is a hill station situated on the outskirts of Panchkula in Haryana close to Chandigarh. Being the only hill stations in Haryana, it is also a popular picnic destination for locals and tourists alike. The hills are 1,220 metres in height and have some really stunning views to offer. </p>
        <p>In addition to being a grand vista point, Morni Hills is also an important archaeological site where carvings dating back to 7th Century have been found in the Thakur Dwar Temple. It is also a great place to engage in trekking and birdwatching. Popular birds sighted here include Wallcreeper, Crested Kingfisher, Bar-tailed Treecreeper, Blue Peafowl, Kalij Pheasant, Red Junglefowl, Grey Francolin, Quails, Himalayan Bulbul and Oriental Turtle Dove.</p>
        <p>Situated at a mere distance of 45 kilometres from Chandigarh, the entire route from the city to these quaint hills makes for a beautiful journey. Forests and mighty pine trees line the way up to the foothills of the Shivaliks before you finally alight at Morni Hills. There are two lakes here as well which are interconnected despite the existence of a hillock in between, such that the water level in both of them remains the same. </p>
        <p>The lake is believed to be auspicious by the locals and is a focal point during many celebrations. The remains of the Morni fort are present quite close to the hills as well. In addition to the landscape, a wide variety of flora and fauna is also present here, which makes it a delight for every nature lover. A hidden haven of nature, Morni Hills is a must-visit for anyone looking for a quick weekend getaway from Chandigarh.</p>
