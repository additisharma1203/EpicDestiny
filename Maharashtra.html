    <h1>Ajanta and Ellora Caves</h1>
    <p><b>Weather: </b>20 - 33°C<br><br>

        <b>Ideal duration:</b> 1-2 days<br><br>
        
        <b>Best Time: </b>June to March </p>
        <p>Ajanta and Ellora caves, considered to be one of the finest examples of ancient rock-cut caves, are located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, India. Ajanta and Ellora caves complex is adorned with beautiful sculptures, paintings, and frescoes and include Buddhist monasteries, Hindu and Jain temples. The Ajanta caves are 29 in number and were built between the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD, whereas the Ellora Caves are more spread out and 34 in number and dates to the period between 6th and 11th Century AD.</p>
        <p>Ajanta and Ellora caves are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are quite popular among travelers worldwide. Ajanta Caves, located around 99km north of Aurangabad, are mostly Buddhist sites and were used as a retreat by Buddhist Monks. Ellora is just 15 km west of Aurangabad and has a better mix of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist sites. These hand-carved caves were built and sponsored by the Indian rulers of those periods and almost buried by thick forests. One of the most famous places in the entire Ajanta and Ellora Caves is the Kailash Temple, which is also the single most massive monolithic structure globally. These rock-cut caves containing carvings are some of the best examples of ancient Indian architecture and sculpture.</p>
        <p><h3>Suggested Itinerary for Ajanta and Ellora Caves </h3>
            <b>Ajanta and Ellora Caves in One Day</b><br>
            Covering both the caves in one day is quite difficult and not recommended to truly enjoy the caves. Also, while Ellora caves is situated around 15 km west of Aurangabad, but the Ajanta caves is around 99km north of Aurangabad. To even think of doing this, you must have a car or taxi of your own and you need to start as early as possible. Also, beware that Ajanta caves are closed on Monday and Ellora caves are closed on Tuesday. So if you plan to do them both in a single day, you must do it on any of day between Wednesday to Sunday. 
            
            Start from Aurangabad and go to Ajanta caves first, which would take roughly 2 and half hours by car. If you leave by 5:30am, then you should reach just on time as the site opens by 8am for visitors. 
            
            Explore there for around 2 and half hours and leave by 10:30am to reach Aurangabad back by 1pm. Have lunch in the city and then get ready to leave for Ellora Caves by 2pm. You should reach in half an hour and you will have another 2 and half hours to explore various parts of Ellora Caves. 
            
            <br><b>Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Two Days</b><br>
            
            Two days are sufficient to cover both the caves and that too by public transport. For Ellora Tour, there are luxury buses that start around 9:30am from the MTDC office on Aurangabad Railway Station Road. This tour also includes several famous sites in Aurangabad. After coming back to Aurangabad, have a good night rest as the next day will involve much more travel. Take the bus to Ajanta Caves the next day from the Aurangabad Central Bus Station located on Aurangabad Road. This bus ride will be roughly 3 hours long, so be prepared and pack some snacks as well. The bus will drop you at Ajanta Caves Road Entrance where some shops and restaurants are present for tourists. From there, you can take another bus to the entrance of the main caves which would hardly take 10 minutes. Beware that these are local buses and can be slightly rough for a lot of tourists.
