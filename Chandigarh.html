        Nestled at the foot of Shivalik Hills, Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh paints a pretty picture. Stretching for a distance of 3 sq. km., Sukhna Lake is a man-made lake and is the only one of its kind in the city created in the year 1958 by damming the seasonal Sukhna Choe (Stream) that flows down the Shivalik Hills. With its pristine blue water, the lake serves as a perfect location for a stream of morning joggers and walkers who can also enjoy the fresh air. In fact, the architect of Chandigarh - India's first planned city - Le Corbusier claimed that this lake would be the centre of wellness pursuits for the residents.<br><br>
        The promenade in front of the lake is frequented by walkers and joggers who carry out their exercise regimes here. Moreover, it also has one of the longest rowing channels in the country that host the Asian Rowing Championships. The best way to enjoy a tour of the Sukhna Lake is to go on a lazy boating tour on it. You can hire a boat for an individual or for a couple, which would cost you between INR 50 - INR 100.<br><br>
        Apart from serving as a delight for artists and photographers, the lake is also a great spot for sports activities such as rowing, trampoline jumping along with the recent addition of a Solar Cruise. It is home to several species of fish and migratory birds such as Siberian ducks and cranes. Bounded by a golf course and the famous Rose Garden, the lake offers a mesmerizing escape to its visitors at all times of the day.

        <b>History of Rock Garden</b> <br>
        Nek Chand started building the Rock Garden secretly near Sukhna Lake in the year 1957. It was based on his vision of the divine kingdom of Sukarni. He would collect waste materials from around the city in his spare time and use them to build structures on a forest buffer land which had been rendered infertile. His work continued for 18 years and spread over 12 acres through a complex of interlinked courtyards. Although his work was illegal, he managed to hide it from the authorities until it was discovered by the authorities in 1975. Rock Garden faced the danger of being demolished on the grounds of being illegal but was saved by popular public opinion. Nek Chand was then put in charge of the park and given a team of 50 labourers to work on his project. The park was opened to the public in 1976 and today is visited daily by around 5,000 people.
