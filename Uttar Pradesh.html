        Located on the banks of River Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh, Agra is a popular tourist destination as it is home to one of the 7 wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal. It is a sneak peek into the architectural history and legacy of the Mughal empire with two other UNESCO World Heritage Sites Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. History, architecture, romance all together create the magic of Agra, and hence, makes for a must-visit for anyone living in or visiting India.<br><br>
        Agra is one of the most populous cities in Uttar Pradesh and 24th most populous city in India. With its long and rich history, it is no wonder that Agra forms part of the popular Golden Triangle Circuit for tourists along with Delhi and Jaipur. It is also a part of the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc including Varanasi and Lucknow. History fanatics and architecture buffs are sure to have a ball here with the sheer expanse of the Mughal art and culture on display.<br><br>
        Apart from its monuments, Agra has some exciting stuff for foodies. It is as famous for its Petha (a sweet made from pumpkin and flavoured with rose water and saffron) as it is for the Taj Mahal. Agra is also well known for its marble artefacts which are best bought in the Sadar Bazaar or Kinaari Bazaar area. <br><br>
        Agra is mostly visited on a one-day trip from New Delhi or other nearby cities in Uttar Pradesh but is totally worth it. Be prepared to be astounded, amazed, inspired and thrilled. However, be a little cautious about conmen in the guise of unofficial tour guides and fake handicrafts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Tips & Scams</b> <br><br>
        1. When visiting the Taj Mahal, clear communicate which gate you want to travel to. Otherwise, you will mostly be dropped at the Shahjahan Garden Road chowk from where you will have to hire another expensive tonga to take you to the main west gate.<br>
        2. Lots of marble souvenirs in Agra are actually alabaster or soapstone. Most of the Taj Mahal marble souvenirs sold are actually alabaster.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Shopping in Agra </b><br><br>
        Agra is primarily known for its monuments, forts, palaces and mausoleums, but, hidden behind these architectural wonders are the traditional shopping centres and bazaars. One of the most commonly bought collectables from Agra is called 'Bric-a-Brac' which is a small marble replica of Taj Mahal.<br>
        Agra is also well-known for its marble artefacts, rugs, leather items and gemstones. Most of the major shopping complexes are situated near the Taj Mahal, the most famous ones being Sadar Bazaar, Kinari Bazaar and Munro Road.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>A confluence of history, culture, and beauty  </b><br><br>
        Who doesn't know about the 'Taj Nagri'? The city, known first in historical sources as Agrevana, or 'The Border of the Forest', is famous for the epitome of love, and one of the 'Seven Wonders of the World'<br>
         i.e. Taj Mahal. The charm of the medieval architecture, which can be noticed even from the top of the Agra Fort, makes it the ultimate destination for travel enthusiasts the world over. Apart from Taj Mahal, this city is also popular for Itimad Ud Daulah's tomb, the famous Agra Fort, and the capital city of Akbar the Great, i.e. Fatehpur Sikri. Apart from being a tourist hotspot, Agra is also famous for its art and crafts industry, which includes the royal craft Pietra Dura, marble inlay and carpets.

        World's oldest living city, Varanasi - also known as Kashi (City of Life) and Benaras, is the spiritual capital of India. It is one of Hinduism's seven holy cities. The old city of Varanasi lies along the western banks of the Ganges, spread across a labyrinth of narrow galis. Be prepared to walk on foot and encounter some holy cows! Temples at almost every turn engulf Varanasi but the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the most visited and the oldest of the lot. Benaras is known as the city of Lord Shiva for a reason, and rightfully so.
        <br><br>Varanasi is considered an auspicious place to die, as it is believed to grant moksha or liberation from the cycle of life and death. One of the city's most iconic features are the 80 ghats along the Ganges, where daily life unfolds against the backdrop of rituals, ceremonies, and spiritual practices. Dashashwamedh Ghat, the main ghat, witnesses the mesmerizing Ganga Aarti, a captivating ritual where priests offer prayers to the river with the rhythmic movement of lamps, fire, and chants. The boat ride along the Ganges during sunrise or sunset provides a serene and immersive experience, allowing visitors to witness the city's timeless beauty.
        <br><br>The narrow winding lanes of Varanasi, known as galis, house numerous shrines, shops, and eateries, creating a maze that leads to hidden gems like the historic Sarnath, where Lord Buddha gave his first sermon. The city is a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds during festivals, especially during Diwali and Holi. The vibrant ghats, adorned with thousands of diyas (lamps) during Diwali, create a mesmerizing spectacle. Varanasi's local markets, such as the Vishwanath Gali and Thatheri Bazaar, offer an array of handcrafted silk, brassware, and traditional Banarasi sarees.
        <br><br>The best time to visit Varanasi is during the winter months (October to March), when the weather is pleasant, and the city is vibrant with festivals and cultural events.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Ganga Aarti </b><br>
        Every evening, Ganga Aarti is performed on the ghats of Varanasi, the most magnificent one at Dashashwamedh Ghat. The aarti commences as dusk descends around 6 pm in winters or 7 pm in summers. Devotees usually gather 90 minutes in advance to find a suitable spot. The spectacle is viewed from the ghat steps, the rooftops of the nearby houses, shops and boats loaded at the riverbanks. It can also be viewed from the rooftop of the organizing committee's office- Ganga Seva Nidhi. The aarti takes place on seven wooden planks, each decorated with saffron clothes and Pooja items like incense sticks, conch shells, brass lamps, etc. The pooja is performed by seven pandits, involving rhythmic chanting of mantras, hymns and prayers in the praise of river Ganges. Millions of spectators gather to witness the most mesmerising and glorious event of Varanasi. The assembly is a confluence of faith, cultures and traditions coming from all parts of India and even abroad. The aarti ends with the blowing of conch shells and lighting of camphor lamps. The whole aarti takes around 45 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>History of Varanasi </b><br>
        Popularly known as Kashi or Benaras, the charming land of Varanasi is the oldest living city in the world. It is a centre of Hindu culture, mythology, literature and art. Its origin dates back to 2500 years ago, when Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvati and chose to make the city their abode. Later the Aryans came and inhabited the city and thus began the trade of silk, muslin, ivory and perfumes. During the Afghan invasion and Muslim rule, Varanasi suffered a destructive phase which involved the demolition and destruction of temples. Its glory was restored during the rule of Mughal emperor, Akbar.

        One of the oldest cities on the banks of Yamuna, Vrindavan is considered to be one of the most important places of pilgrimage for the devotees of Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna had spent his childhood in Vrindavan. The name of the city has been derived from Vrinda (meaning basil) and van (meaning grove) which perhaps refer to the two small groves at Nidhivan and Seva Kunj. Since Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place, a large number of people come here to abandon their worldly life.<br><br>
        The city of Vrindavan hosts hundreds of Lord Krishna and Radha temples scattered throughout, the most famous ones being Banke Bihari temple and the world-famous ISKCON temple. The vibrant surroundings perfectly depict the playful and benevolent nature of Lord Krishna. Located along the waters of River Yamuna, the numerous temples set amidst the thick woods and lush greenery of Vrindavan are the major attractions here.

    <p>
        <b>Holi Celebrations in Vrindavan Dham </b><br>
        Holi is one of the most famous festivals that is celebrated in India, that too on a grand scale. However, the Holi celebration in Braj is the most famous. Braj is a historical region that covers Mathura, Vrindavan and some areas in proximity. Holi in Braj attracts tourists and pilgrims in huge numbers every year from all over the world. This is mainly due to its unique customs and traditions. The Banke Bihari temple celebrates the phool-vali-holi (Holi with flowers). It is also considered to be the most. Just as the name suggests, it is played with flowers and not with the traditional colours. It celebrated on the Ekadashi before Holi.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Legend of Vrindavan Dham </b><br>
        Around 15 km from Mathura, Vrindavan is a town of innumerable temples dotted across its landscape. According to legends, Lord Krishna spent his childhood days in the town of Vrindavan. It is a prominent and most dearly loved town by devotees of Lord Krishna.<br><br>
        Vrindavan borrows its name from Vrinda, which means Tulsi (Holy Basil) and the town was said to be a basil-grove once. Vrindavan is widely famous for its extravagant mentions in scriptures and anecdotes related to Lord Krishna. The town is peculiarly flocked by widows, hence Vrindavan is also a city of widows.
    </p>
    <p>
        <B>History of Vrindavan Dham </B><br>
        Vrindavan is said to be as old as the Maurya Dynasty that ruled the city from 325 BC to 184 BC. During the 3000 BC, Vrindavan was known as an urbanised trade and commercial settlement. It was rediscovered in 1515 when the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu went out on a venture to look for the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The city was built in 1590. During the last 250 years, the forests and grove in Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanisation. The forest cover has been slowly cleared by apartment developers and only a few patches of forest are left.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Restaurants and Local Food in Vrindavan </b><br>
        The food available in Vrindavan is only pure vegetarian and often even without any onion or garlic. However, the city's food is still quite flavourful and is full of colours and richness in it. A typical platter here is incomplete without Aloo-Puri, Pakoras and Lassi. The town also houses quite a variety from traditional snacks and delicacies on the street to global cuisines with the finest cheesecakes, salads and lasagna. The other relishes of the town that you must try, include Hing ki Kachori, Kachori-Sabzi, Chana- Bhatura, Chhole-Poori as well as sweets such as Pedhe, Laddos, Rabri, Jalebi, Kheer, Kalakand, Khurchan, Balushai and many more.
