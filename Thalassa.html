    <p>Perched atop rocky cliffs, Thalassa- The Greek Taverna is one of the most popular restaurants in Goa. Having moved out to the backwaters along with Siolim (from its prior location of Vagator hilltop), Thalassa is famous for its signature cocktails and sunsets. Reverberating with the cultural flavour of Greece, it serves authentic Greek Mediterranean cuisine.</p>
    <p>Ideated, owned and conceived by Mariketty (known to be the most hospitable hostess), the open-air restaurant boasts of comfortable cushioned chairs, rustic wooden decor, lively music and a gorgeous ambience. One of the main highlights of Thalassa is the live-fire show and dance performances like Sirtaki and Zorba.</p>
    <p>Boasting of delectable cuisines and a mouth-watering menu, the restaurant has been visited by big-shot celebrities like Robert de Niro and other Bollywood stars.</p>
