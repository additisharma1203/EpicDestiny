        The All India War Memorial, popularly known as the India Gate, is located along the Rajpath in New Delhi. The imposing structure of India Gate is an awe-inspiring sight and is often compared to the Arch de Triomphe in France, the Gateway of India in Mumbai and the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This 42-meter tall historical structure was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of the largest war memorials in the country. India Gate is also famous for hosting the Republic Day Parade every year. <br><br>
        Dedicated to 82,000 Indian and British soldiers who died during the First World War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, this monument has the names of 13,300 servicemen inscribed on its surface. The premises of India Gate also houses the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which is a kindled structure right underneath the archway. Owing to its rich historical background and astonishing architecture, India Gate has become one of the most popular picnic spots in the city.

    <p>
        <b>History of India Gate </b><br>
        The construction of the India Gate started in the year 1921, and it was a part of the British initiative to build graves and memorials for all the Indian and British soldiers who represented the British Empire in the First World War. The Duke of Connaught laid the foundation stone of the war memorial on 10th February 1921, and the memorial was finally inaugurated by Lord Irwin, India's Viceroy on 12th February 1931. It was dedicated to all the soldiers who laid their lives during the war so that the future generations would remember them for the noble sacrifice they made for the love of their country.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Amar Jawan Jyoti </b><br>
        Below the India Gate, lies a small shrine-like structure made up of black marble, which always has a fire burning in it. Amar Jawan Jyoti or the Flame of Immortal Soldier was constructed under the India Gate after the Indo-Pakistani war in the year 1971 to pay respect to all the soldiers who died in the Bangladesh Liberation War. It has a black cenotaph placed on the top of a marble pedestal. 'Amar Jawan' is scripted in gold on all the four sides of the cenotaph. On the top of the cenotaph, an inverted L1A1 self-loading rifle is placed with a helmet of a soldier. The marble pedestal is bound by four urns, one of which has a continuously burning flame. The memorial is guarded 24/7 by soldiers of Indian Army, Indian Navy and Air Force.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Inscription on India Gate </b><br>
        On both the sides of the arch of India Gate, 'India' is inscribed in the capital with dates MCMXIV (1914) and MCMXIX (1919) on its either sides. Below the word 'India', in capital letters, is inscribed: "To the dead of the Indian armies who fell and are honoured in France and Flanders Mesopotamia and Persia East Africa Gallipoli and elsewhere in the near and the far-east in sacred memory also of those whose names are here recorded and who fell in India or the north-west frontier and during the Third Afghan War."

        As the name suggests, Humayun's tomb is the final resting place of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Located in the Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, it is the first garden-tomb in the Indian subcontinent. This splendid piece of architecture was commissioned for construction by Humayun's chief consort Empress Bega Begum in the year 1569-70 and is one of the very few structures that used red sandstone on such a massive scale at that time. The design of Humayun's tomb is a typical Mughal architecture with Persian influences and was conceptualised by Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyath. Owing to its magnificent design and illustrious history, Humayun's Tomb was featured in UNESCO's World Heritage List in the year 1993.<br><br>
        The architectural genius of Humayun's tomb is hard to miss. This magnificent tomb sits in the middle of a huge, ornate Mughal Garden and its beauty is only enhanced during the winter months. Situated on the banks of the River Yamuna, this mausoleum is also home to the remains of many other Mughals, including his wives, son and descendants of the later Emperor Shah Jahan, as well as numerous other subsequent Mughals.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Architecture of Humayun's Tomb </b><br>
        The structure of Humayun's tomb is a mix of Islamic and Persian architecture with smatterings of Indian elegance too. Six-sided stars that embellish the main opening on the west, are also seen on the main tomb structure, though it has been used as a patterned galactic symbol. The mosque also has the tomb of Emperor's beloved barber. The tomb built of debris of granite and red sandstone uses white marble as a covering material. It has main features of Indian - Islamic architecture like jaalis, door frames and chhajja. It stands on a leaped terrace eight-metre high and spread over 12,000-meter square. This tomb houses over 100 gravestones and the entire base structure is elevated on a stage, a few steps high.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Char Bagh Garden </b><br>
        The Char-Bagh is a Persian style garden with a geometric layout, and divided into 4 square walkways, giving it the name, Char Bagh. The four squares are further subdivided into smaller pathways, creating 36 squares. The central water system flows beneath the ground, feeding the mini fountains without appearing at the surface. The garden is enclosed within rubble walls on three sides while the fourth opening serves as an inlet to the river Yamuna, which unfortunately no longer flows here. The gardens are exquisitely maintained and will certainly transport you the times of the royalty with their charms.
